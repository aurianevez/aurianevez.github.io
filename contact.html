    <p> I am a white cis* Swiss woman and I was born in <b>Switzerland</b> in <b>1993</b>. I currently live in Switzerland tho I have lived in the US and in Australia. I have been lucky enough to travel around the world and see its diversity. Today, I am hoping and projecting to start a new adventure in Sweden.</p>

    <p>*You might wonder why I stated that I am a white cis woman. I consider that gender is a spectrum and not a binary category as constructed by the society. Hence, by stating it, I am advocating that there is no normal only a diversity of people. Finally, writing that I am white is pointing out that I am aware of priviledges that come with it...</p>
