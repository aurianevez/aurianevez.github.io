    <h6> * My journey on the Yogic path *</h6>

    <p> My journey on the Yogic Path did not start long ago, however, it has already deeply impacted my life. In <b>june 2021, I complited
        my 200 hours Yoga teacher training (Vinyasa and Hatha) </b>, in Costa Rica, with the School Yoga Institute. It was a wild journey,
        I improved so much my Asana practice, learned so much more about the yogic philosophy - I love to read and reflect on the yoga 
        sutras - and deepened my spiritual practice. It was also quite an intense human relation journey, learning to navigate different
        style of teaching, staying with an open heart and learning the ways in which I want to give to the world. During this training,
        my passion for holding space for people was deepened and I learned that it was appreciated. It really motivates me to continue on
        this path.</p>

    <h6> * My understanding and vision of Yoga *</h6>

    <p>Yoga is, for me, much more than only practicing Asana and therefore I do not see Yoga as a (relaxing) work out. I really approach 
        Yoga through a lens of spiritual practice. <i>It is really important for me to praticipate the least possible in the western 
        cultural appropriation of Yoga </i> (tho I think it will happen, despite my effort not to, as it is a learning in progress..).
        Therefore, Practicing Yoga for me involves, among other things, meditation, pranayama, having an intention for the practice that
        touches upon the sutras for example, and making sure that there is enough time for savasana at the end of the class
        (just to give a few example of what yoga is for me). I am aware that this subject is sensitive and by no means I intend to offend
        or accuse anyone, but it matters to me to share my view/approach of Yoga on this page.    
    </p>

    <h6> * Yoga and Social justice *</h6>

    <p>I am deeply passionated about social justice and making this world a better place to live for everyone. In our society people who
        experience daily aggressions from systemic inequalities not only embody those aggressions but also evolve in a survival mode.
        I truly belive that the Practice of Yoga can deeply impact people's life, as they gently shift from their fight or fly mode to 
        a more secure state. However, people who experience those structural inequalities often don't have access to the practice of Yoga.
        That is why I would love to give classes in community center and use it in my social work.</p>
    
    <p> I would like to link this reflection with the Sutra 1.11 and its interpretation from Nischala Joy devi:</p>
    <h6><font size="3">अनुभूतविषयासंप्रमोषः स्मृतिः - anu-bhūta-viṣaya-asaṁpramoṣaḥ smr̥tiḥ </font></h6>
    <h6><font size="2">"Memory is when a previous experience returns to conscious awarness"</font></h6>

    <p>Nischala Joy Devi writes that we need to "weed" and "release" the memories in our consciousness in order to evolve. She writes
        that if not released, we are then anchored in the past. Devi interprets memories as impressions and I would add trauma to this
        understanding. She then writes <i>"The yogic practices help us release memories without having to express them either outwardly or
        in dreams"</i>. She also mentions how siting in meditation or while in poses memories can resurface. However, as this happens
        in a "*safe" space, the person can control the memories instead of being controlled by them. This illustrates the work I would love to
        do with people, creating space, where they can release past Trauma from their mind and body. I truly believe that this 
        understanding of this sutra holds great wisdom in term of how Yoga allow people to heal thermselves, but it also highlights the
        responsibility of holding space as a Yoga teacher. 
    </p>
    <p> <font size="-1.5">*safe: I use safe for the lack fo better terms, but I consider we cannot really proclaim creating a "safe" environment as we 
        cannot truly know how people feel.
