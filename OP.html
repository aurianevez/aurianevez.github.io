                <font size="+2"> <i> Emotions in the classroom </i> </font>
                <p>Over time my academic identity developed. Evolving within university reinforced my existing student identity: hard-working, average, dyslexic, never good enough, too emotional and nonconformist. Education has over time tarnished my self-esteem. Yet, the storyline could have been completely different with an education system as a space of self-development instead of self-deprecation. Indeed, hooks (2003) asserts that if school are spaces that are organized with “the art of obedience through authority and accepting of dominator-based hierarchy” (p.20), it doesn’t have to and should not be this way. Instead, hooks argues that school should be a space where emotions and excitement are allowed and encouraged. Classrooms should be places where “students [have] to be seen in their particularity as individuals […] and interacted with according to their needs” (hooks 2014, p.7). According to her, classrooms should be seen as communal spaces where everyone is responsible for the classroom dynamic (hooks, 2014). Feelings of community and belonging is created by teachers and  students. In Similarly, Bostow et al. (2015) assert that lived experience need to be recognized as valid and valuable knowledge. Consequently, rationalism is rejected and beliefs, values and convictions, which are emotions, are invited into the classroom in order to get a more critical understanding of knowledge (Bostow et al., 2015). </font></p>
                <font size="+2"> <i> Critical Empathy Toolkit </i> </font>
                <p> Based on these ideas, members of my group and I developed a toolkit that aims at giving agency back to students throughout their learning process. We draw from our own experiences as student as well as from the work of Camfield et al. (2020) who developed tools rooted in critical empathy. Critical empathy aims at transforming classrooms as spaces of co-creation between students and teachers (Camfield and Moore, 2020). Students reclaims their agency and power by collaborating as the creation of course policies and activities. Critical empathy welcomes emotions and acknowledge that life exist outside of the classroom which cannot be separated from one another. The focus on learning experience shift from performance to Process where assessment becomes a space of dialogue, where invisible learning is honored and where outcomes are emerging and not defined beforehand.
                    
                    <br>  
                    <br>
                    In practice, our toolkit comprised the following elements:
                    <br>
                    <br> 
                    
                    1)	Co-creation of assessment rubric: based on interpretation of the formulated learning outcomes. (Camfield and Moore, 2020) 
                    <br>
                    2)	Defining deadlines as a class 
                    <br>
                    3)	Honoring invisible learning with student using marginal space to comment their work and create dialogue (Camfield and Moore, 2020, Camfield et al., 2020b) 
                    <br>
                    4)	Self-Grading based on co-created rubric 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These tools contribute at creating an interdependent learning experience where students do not have to demonstrate and provide to the teacher, but instead focus on growing as individuals and develop their positionality as well as academic identity (Camfield and Moore, 2020). It also creates space for emotions to be expressed and informs teachers of the work done which can be appreciated and prevent wrong assumptions to be made on the lack of efforts. Teacher are also provided with immediate feedback. Finally, the learning process is now owned by students. Consequently, throughout this process students reclaim their agency. 
                    </p>

                <font size="+2"> <i> Implementation </i> </font>
                <p>Implementation of this toolkit could be done through various means. However, views within our group varied. In my opinion, focus should be on students. Indeed, a document could be put together for students to use and approach their teachers. Bringing systemic change within such big institution and years of practices is really hard. That is why I believe that a bottom up approach starting from students would be more impactful. This would also enable dialogue and start the co-creation process. Moreover, by focusing on students, agency and power are retrieved. Indeed, even if the teacher does not welcome the approach students can still honor their invisible learning by providing commentary to their work. I have been applying it and find it really empowering. It also allowed my academic identity to evolve. Simultaneously, universities could be approached as well as the education ministry through lobbying. However, this requires a lot of investment and time, which is less likely to happen (however, other members of my group considered that aspect central to the implementation). Finally, there is the hope that once approached teachers would exchange about it with their peers.</p>
                <font size="+2"> <i> Contribution to mitigating inequality </i> </font>
                <p>This toolkit, if applied and accepted by teachers, can mitigate inequalities. I will illustrate my statement with a personal story. As a dyslexic student I have experienced a lot of discrimination. Indeed, universities are institution that are “inherently white, racist and ableist” (Mehta 2019, p.29). Expecting perfect spelling is rooted in coloniality and the hegemony of western knowledge making. According to Mignolo (2009), knowledge is considered as valuable and serious if written in English, French or German. Consequently, the mastering of a language reflects the level of culture of the writer. Work written in other languages suffer from epistemic injustices as the west is connected to reason and the rest to culture. This is “the modern/colonial foundation of control of knowledge” (Mignolo 2009, p.162). Over the years, assumptions have been made by the teachers that this was the results of my lack of effort and their judgment took the attention away from the content of my work (Camfield et al., 2020). This toolkit would have enabled me to redirect the focus of the professor on my critical thinking. Indeed, by commenting my work I would emphasis the critical thinking done which could not be ignored. By commenting my work I would also feel empowered as I put emphasis on my intellectual work. Moreover, throughout defining the assessment criteria, I could mention my dyslexia and emphasis on how spelling should not be included in the criteria. This would stop the professor to expect the worst from me/students (Camfield and Moore, 2020). Power dynamic are also reshuffled. Indeed, Crabtree and Sapp (2003) asserts that classrooms are spaces for teachers to exercise their power. Throughout defining the assessment criteria and self-grading, power is redistributed. Consequently, through this collaboration students and teachers are held accountable of knowledge production and assessment. If taken seriously this toolkit could also enable teacher to critically reflect on their identities as professor as well as on their internal narratives about student (Camfield and Moore, 2020, Camfield et al. 2020). Therefore, by redistributing power this kind of approaches challenge the hierarchy and the notion of rigor within education (Camfield and Moore, 2020, Camfield et al., 2020). We can then transition from performance (expecting perfect spelling) to process (acknowledging how little spelling mistakes are present and focusing on ideas). </p>
                <font size="+2"> <i> Limitations </i> </font>
                <p>The main limitation is the willingness of the teacher to acknowledge the power dynamic present in the classroom. As mentioned above, power is redistributed which means that the professor lose some of its control over the dynamic of the course as well as over students. Moreover, they must be willing to also reflect on their position in society as an all. It was mentioned in a class discussion that if the professor is a white cis straight male it might be more challenging to create such discussion as they benefit from all privileges in a patriarchal society. Indeed, according to Tisdell (1993) male professor are more controlling than their female [and probably non-binary] peers. Another element that might limit this implementation is how it requires to shift paradigm and habits. Indeed, it requires from the student to intentionally reflect on their work, which might require extra work. Moreover, during the discussion after our presentation, people suggested that it might also require more work from the teacher. As a matter of fact, the teacher has to critically reflect on their mode of teaching, but also work with the class to define the assessment criteria. Defining the assessment criteria would also take time on the very tight teaching schedule. Finally, a last suggestion made during the discussion was that by giving space to emotions conflict might arise which can be overwhelming when emotions were previously not welcomed in the classroom and requires emotional maturity from the teacher. </p>
                <font size="+2"> <i> Moving forward  </i> </font>   
                <p>Those limitations are valid points. However, they should not stop us from trying new forms of education. Indeed, there is one thing certain, change is needed. There is the need for a feminist and decolonial pedagogy (hooks, 2014). This toolkit challenges inequalities within the education system and enables students to regain agency in the process of learning (Camfield et al., 2020). Emotions are not always comfortable, and the risk of facing conflict should be taken into considered. However, it does not mean we should not implement it. Indeed, it is only through practice and more discussion that conflict will truly be settled. In fact, this conflict would have probably existed, but internally. What I mean by this is that those emotions would have probably existed, but would have not been expressed by the person experiencing them. Consequently, by expressing their emotions, people learn to set boundaries and express the way they experience reality. By doing so, I believe that not only over time conflict can be avoided, but also personal growth can result from it. Camfield et al. (2020) assert that eventually “students who have empathy-based relationship with their professor are more engaged, motivated, resilient, and efficacious” (p.128). It goes the same for the teacher. Feminist and decolonial work/pedagogy might feel uncomfortable (to student and teacher) because they challenge the status co and habits, but eventually it is empowering and freeing. Limitations as well as being a student and teacher need to be embraced and reflected upon (Camfield et al., 2020). The implementation also needs to be context specific and adapted to the needs of the classroom. Finally, critical empathy invites us to ask ourselves, what kind of student/teacher do I want to be? How do I want to grow within this institution? What kind of education do I want to experience? </p>
