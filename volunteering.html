    <p> During my research semester at the University of Queensland I joined a group of womxn* pursuing interesectional feminist endeavour in order to fight structural inequalities and injustices. This was a wonderful experience as I collaborated with determined, strong and engaged womxn. It was very empowering to stand in solidarity with other womxn, where collaboration and support were replacing competition and judgment. The bottom up structure allowed me to reflect on power dynamic which not only was useful for my writing but also at a personal level. Indeed, as I tend to take initiatives, it was great to talk openly with my peers about my relating fears. I understood that it was ok to lead at various moment and that my leadership was considering and respectful.</p>

    <h6>Womxn Cricle</h6>
    <p>My main contribution was the elaboration of the workshop for the womxn circle, as I had previously followed a community development class  at the University of Queensland. After talking with the womxn of my group about the intention behind the workshop, I used tools that I learned to elaborate the workshop and incorporated the ideas that had been suggested during our conversation, like the role play. Below is the presentation that we created based on the structure of the workshop.</p>

    <p>The spectrum energizer aimed to create a share consciousness as a group and allowed womxn to situate themselves among other. It also unabled really interesting conversation and the most privileged of us could reconsider where they situated themselves on the different spectrums. After that, we created small groups to enable deeper conversations which then could be shared in bigger groups. We then designed poster about different situations about every day sexism and our answer, or wished answer, which would then serve for the role play. Indeed, the idea behind the roal play was to embody powerful answer in order to better handle future situations. The wrapping up allowed some womxn to share that it was their first time being in a safe space where they could talk bout their experiences and feelings about being a womxn in patriarchal society. We also all conclud that if in most situations it was important to speak up and stand for ourself, in some cases it was safer to leave without reacting. </p>
